## Overview ☁📰⌚
This was my first time coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This webpage gets the local weather forecast, top news headlines, and season stats of any NHL team. I will hopefully update it in the future. The code is a little messy so feel free to fix anything. Once you have setup an Openweather and Gnews account you will have to go into the javascript code to change the API keys. You can tailor Gnews to show your specific headlines as well as the Api-Sports to show different teams, or even sports.

## API & Resources 🔗
* [OpenWeather](https://openweathermap.org/)
* [GNews API](https://gnews.io/)
* [HTML Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_attributes.asp)
* [CSS Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/css/default.asp)
* [Javascript Tutorials](https://www.w3schools.com/js/)
* [Api-Sports](https://dashboard.api-football.com/)

## Notes 
* The `navigator.geolocation.getCurrentPosition()` does not work on open-source browsers such as Chromium as they do not contain the predefined API-keys
