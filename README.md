General information website using: HTML+CSS+Javascript

## Overview ☁📰⌚
This was my first time coding in HTML, CSS, and Javascript. This webpage gets the local weather forecast as well as the top news headlines. I will hopefully update it in the future. The code is a little messy so feel free to fix anything.
